## ✨ Welcome to my profile! ✨

### About me 👨🏽‍💻

<p>👋🏽 Hey, Dev! My name is Thiago Brito (also known as James Brito) 🤝🏽 and I'm a front-end developer passionate about technology and solving real world 🗺 problems through lines of code 🎯.</p>

<p>For me, <em>being a developer is an art, which is essentially based on the perception that everything around you has not yet reached its full potential and that it is up to you to make it reach.</em></p>

### Technologies stack ⚒

<p>Since I feel that I have achieved a relatively solid foundation in website development over these last 6 months, I am currently working with:</p>

### Contacts 🚀

<p>Well, to finish this short summary about me, I would like to say that, for loving and being immersed in the world of technology, I'm always looking to learn, share and apply new technologies and concepts to my projects and my life as a developer; and I think it would be really amazing to have, by my side, people who share this same vision, therefore, if that also makes sense to you, feel free to get in touch with me for here or through the platforms below. See you around, Dev!</p>
